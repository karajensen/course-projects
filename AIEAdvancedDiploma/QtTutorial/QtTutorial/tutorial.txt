Install Qt. I have used the 'Qt 5.3.1 with OpenGL' or qt-opensource-windows-x86-msvc2013-5.3.1.exe installer for this tutorial. Depending on the version of Qt it will require different dlls to be packaged with your executable. If you choose to use a different version you may need to experiment to find which dlls you do or don't need.

Create a new visual studio Win32 empty project. Once done, right mouse click on the project name in the Solution Explorer to go to the Property Pages. Under Configuration Properties and then General change the following settings:

Output Directory:          $(SolutionDir)$(SolutionName)\
Intermediate Directory:    $(SolutionDir)$(SolutionName)\$(Configuration)\
Target Name (Debug):       $(ProjectName)D
Target Name (Release):     $(ProjectName)

Navigate to where Qt is installed. This will be something like: C:\Qt\Qt5.3.1. Navigate to Qt5.3.1\5.3\msvc2013\plugins. Copy the platforms folder and paste it in the same folder as the .vcxproj files for your new project are. Next navigate to Qt5.3.1\5.3\msvc2013\bin. Copy the following .dlls into the same folder as the .vcxproj files:

icudt52.dll
icuin52.dll
icuuc52.dll
libEGL.dll
libEGLd.dll
libGLESv2.dll
libGLESv2d.dll
Qt5Core.dll
Qt5Cored.dll
Qt5Gui.dll
Qt5Guid.dll
Qt5Widgets.dll
Qt5Widgetsd.dll

You may or may not need more .dlls depending on what you choose to include in your Qt GUI. For this tutorial these .dlls are enough.

Go back to the Property Pages for your project. Under C/C++ and then General change the following settings:

Additional Include Directories: C:\Qt\Qt5.3.1\5.3\msvc2013\include

Under Linker and then General change the following settings:

Additional Library Directories: C:\Qt\Qt5.3.1\5.3\msvc2013\lib

Under Linker and then Input change the following settings:

Additional Dependencies: Qt5Cored.lib;Qt5Guid.lib;Qt5Widgetsd.lib;qtmaind.lib

Make sure you change the settings for the Release Configuration too. 

Create a new .cpp file and call it main. This will hold the main loop for both the application and GUI.
